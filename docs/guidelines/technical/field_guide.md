# Technical Field Guide

## Overview
This field guide provides technical standards and best practices for our consulting engagements.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All code must pass linting checks before deployment
- Unit tests must achieve 90% code coverage
- Code reviews are mandatory for all changes
- Follow the established coding standards for each language

### Database Management
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Regular database backups are required
- Document all schema changes

### API Design
- Use RESTful principles for API design
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Version all APIs appropriately
- Provide comprehensive API documentation

### Security Practices
- Implement authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Deployment Procedures

### Pre-deployment Checklist

2. Code review completed
3. Security scan completed
4. Performance testing completed
5. Documentation updated

### Deployment Process
- Use automated deployment pipelines
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Monitor deployment metrics
- Have rollback procedures ready

### Post-deployment
- Monitor application performance
- Check error logs
- Verify all functionality
- Update stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Database connection timeouts
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- Network latency issues
- Third-party service failures

### Debugging Steps
1. Check application logs
2. Verify system resources
3. Test connectivity
4. Review recent changes
5. Consult with team members
