Today I focused on several important activities. I started by working on the Microsoft customer support ticket backlog, resolving approximately 15 tickets that had been pending for more than a week. After that, I moved on to updating our internal knowledge base with new troubleshooting procedures that our team developed last month. The afternoon was spent implementing the new chat bot functionality for the Apple project that will help automate responses to common customer inquiries. I also spent time training the junior support staff on the new escalation procedures we implemented. Finally, I attended the weekly Google product team meeting where we discussed upcoming features and their potential impact on our support workload.
