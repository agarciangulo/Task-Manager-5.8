Yesterday's work summary:

**Client Work:**
• Fixed the payment processing bug that was affecting international customers for Facebook project
• Conducted a training session for new team members on the Amazon integration

I also spent considerable time working on the mobile app optimization project for Netflix. This involved analyzing performance metrics, identifying bottlenecks in the checkout process, and implementing several UI improvements that should reduce cart abandonment rates.

Next steps:
1. Deploy the payment fix to production
2. Monitor error rates after deployment

Additionally, I need to review the competitor analysis report that the marketing team prepared for the Spotify project and provide technical feedback on the features they've identified as potential additions to our platform.
