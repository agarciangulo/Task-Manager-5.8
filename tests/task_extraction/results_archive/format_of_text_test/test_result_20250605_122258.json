  "prompt": "You are TaskExtractor, an expert system that extracts structured task updates from both formal and casual work logs, emails, and messages.\n\nYOUR TASK:\nExtract actionable tasks from the provided text, which may be in various formats (formal reports, casual updates, bullet points, etc.). Follow these precise steps:\n\n1. TEXT ANALYSIS:\n   - Identify the main author of the update\n   - Look for any date information\n   - Recognize different formats (bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.)\n   - Handle both formal and casual language\n\n2. SENDER IDENTIFICATION:\n   - Extract the full name of the person who performed the tasks\n   - Look for patterns like \"From:\", email signatures, or introductory lines\n   - If no name is found, use the email sender's name\n\n3. TASK EXTRACTION STRATEGIES:\n   - Look for tasks in any format: bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.\n   - Extract tasks from both completed and planned sections\n   - Recognize tasks even without explicit \"Completed\" or \"Planned\" labels\n   - Identify action verbs to determine what work was performed\n   - Ignore non-task information like greetings and signatures\n   - IMPORTANT: Extract ALL items as tasks, even single words like \"Resume\" or \"Training\"\n\n4. VAGUE TASK DETECTION (CRITICAL):\n   - Flag tasks as needing more context (set needs_description=true) if they match ANY of these criteria:\n     * Single-word tasks (e.g., \"Resume\", \"Training\", \"Meeting\")\n     * Short phrases without specific details (e.g., \"VC University\", \"Project work\")\n     * Generic descriptions (e.g., \"Worked on project\", \"Made updates\")\n     * Tasks missing what was actually done (e.g., \"Resume\" instead of \"Updated resume\")\n     * Tasks without clear deliverables or outcomes\n   - For each vague task, generate a specific follow-up question asking for:\n     * What specifically was done\n     * What was the outcome or progress made\n     * Any relevant details about the work\n\n5. STATUS DETERMINATION - CLASSIFY AS:\n   - \"Completed\": Tasks described in past tense or marked as done\n   - \"In Progress\": Work mentioned as started but not finished\n   - \"Pending\": Tasks mentioned without completion status\n   - \"Blocked\": Tasks explicitly mentioned as blocked\n\n6. DATE EXTRACTION:\n   - Extract the date when tasks were performed\n   - If not explicitly mentioned, use the email/update date\n   - Standardize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n   - For updates with multiple dates, use the most recent relevant date\n\n7. CATEGORIZATION:\n   - Assign each task to a category based on context\n   - Use section headers, indentation, or prefix labels to determine categories\n   - If a task mentions multiple categories, prefer the most specific one\n   - If no category is explicitly mentioned, use \"General\"\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn a list of tasks in this exact format:\n[\n    {\n        \"task\": \"Detailed description of the task\",\n        \"status\": \"Completed/In Progress/Pending/Blocked\",\n        \"employee\": \"Full name of the person who did the task\",\n        \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n        \"category\": \"Category name\",\n        \"needs_description\": true/false,\n        \"suggested_question\": \"Specific follow-up question for vague tasks\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\nEXAMPLE VAGUE TASKS AND QUESTIONS:\n1. Task: \"Resume\"\n   Question: \"Could you specify what you did with your resume? (e.g., updated specific sections, created new version, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n2. Task: \"VC University\"\n   Question: \"What specific work did you do related to VC University? (e.g., completed specific modules, watched lectures, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n3. Task: \"Meeting\"\n   Question: \"What was this meeting about and what were the key outcomes or decisions made?\"\n   needs_description: true\n\nINPUT TEXT:\nFrom: Jason Steele <evan48@young-martinez.com>\nTo: Kevin Pearson <dianevillanueva@hotmail.com>\nDate: 2025-04-27 22:33:32\nSubject: Daily Work Summary\n\nPlanned Activities:\nCI/CD Pipeline Update\n    Finalized the analytics hooks related to CI/CD Pipeline Update., Investigated slow response times in the CI/CD Pipeline Update component., Coordinated with the design team to review the CI/CD Pipeline Update feature flow., Implemented logging improvements for CI/CD Pipeline Update..\n\nMarketing Dashboard\n    Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Marketing Dashboard., Revised error handling strategy in Marketing Dashboard to support fallback flows., Finalized the analytics hooks related to Marketing Dashboard., Coordinated with the design team to review the Marketing Dashboard feature flow..\n\nContent Management Refactor\n    Revised error handling strategy in Content Management Refactor to support fallback flows., Implemented logging improvements for Content Management Refactor., Created unit tests for Content Management Refactor edge cases..\n\nPayment Gateway Integration\n    Refactored the Payment Gateway Integration module to improve clarity and maintainability., Implemented logging improvements for Payment Gateway Integration., Created unit tests for Payment Gateway Integration edge cases., Documented changes related to the Payment Gateway Integration rollout., Revised error handling strategy in Payment Gateway Integration to support fallback flows..\n\nCompleted Activities:\nMobile App Performance\n    Documented changes related to the Mobile App Performance rollout., Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Mobile App Performance..\n\nAuthentication Revamp\n    Refactored the Authentication Revamp module to improve clarity and maintainability., Investigated slow response times in the Authentication Revamp component., Revised error handling strategy in Authentication Revamp to support fallback flows., Coordinated with the design team to review the Authentication Revamp feature flow..\n\nCustomer Feedback Analysis\n    Refactored the Customer Feedback Analysis module to improve clarity and maintainability., Revised error handling strategy in Customer Feedback Analysis to support fallback flows..\n\nPayment Gateway Integration\n    Implemented logging improvements for Payment Gateway Integration., Refactored the Payment Gateway Integration module to improve clarity and maintainability., Coordinated with the design team to review the Payment Gateway Integration feature flow..\n\nUser Onboarding Redesign\n    Coordinated with the design team to review the User Onboarding Redesign feature flow., Documented changes related to the User Onboarding Redesign rollout., Finalized the analytics hooks related to User Onboarding Redesign., Refactored the User Onboarding Redesign module to improve clarity and maintainability., Resolved a blocking bug in the User Onboarding Redesign flow..\n\nRemember:\n- Extract ALL tasks, even single words or short phrases\n- Flag ANY task that lacks specific details about what was done\n- Generate specific, contextual follow-up questions for vague tasks\n- Use context clues to determine status and categories\n- If a task is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions but still flag for verification\n- Always return a list, even if empty\n",
