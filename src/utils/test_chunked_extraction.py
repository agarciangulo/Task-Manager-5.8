Here are my tasks for today:
- Attornato:
     - Worked with Paula to continue building outreach emails and supporting documentation for nonprofits
     - Connect with Emiliana on the emails
- Task Manager AI Agent:
     - Ran a healthcheck that the end to end process worked. Found some bugs I needed to fix (embedding manager, coaching insights generator, PostgreSQL connection with gmail processor) and worked with cursor to fix them. All works as expected now
     - Started evolving the PostgreSQL database to connect with a cloudbased storage where the bodies of the emails will be stored. This will help with speed of processing and storage capabilities
     - Went through the conversations and notes we've taken and put together immediate next steps for the tool to do on the short term
     - Follow up with Daniel on who will be taking over and start setting up time with them
- BCG:
     - Ran through two cases with Ana and gathered a lot of feedback. Printed more copies to be ready to do 2 - 3 a day with her and keep training
     - Read a chapter and a half of Hacking the Case Interview and a learning block from RocketBlock
Grad School Preparation
     - Received more information on the loan structure / amount that I will be able to apply for and am working to set up a call with student funding to answer some outstanding questions I have
     - Think about the position and start brainstorming / writing the application, discuss with daniel and review linkedin profiles of people that have gone through it
- Admin:
     - Went back to the T-Mobile store to get my new phone but they told me they couldn't because the phone was damaged so I submitted a new claim with the insurance and they said they'd fix it
