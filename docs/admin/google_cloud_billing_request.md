# Google Cloud Billing Credit Request

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Subject:** Request for Billing Credit - Unused PostgreSQL Database Instance

Dear Google Cloud Support Team,

I am writing to request a billing credit for charges incurred on my Google Cloud account related to a PostgreSQL database instance that was created but never utilized.

## **Background**

During the development of a personal project, I was following AI-assisted setup instructions to configure a PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud. Unfortunately, during this process, a high-tier database instance was provisioned without my full understanding of the cost implications.

## **Key Details**

- **Account ID:** [Your Google Cloud Account ID]
- **Project ID:** [Your Project ID]
- **Instance Name:** [Database Instance Name]
- **Period:** [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Total Charges:** Approximately $500
- **Usage Status:** Database remained completely empty with no data or connections

## **Circumstances**

1. **Development Context:** This was a personal development project, not a production system
2. **No Actual Usage:** The database instance was never populated with data or accessed by applications
3. **Immediate Action:** Upon discovering the charges, I immediately stopped and deleted the instance
4. **Honest Mistake:** This was an unintentional oversight during the learning and setup process

## **Request**

I am requesting a one-time courtesy credit for these charges based on the following factors:

- The database was never used for any purpose
- This was a development/testing environment, not a production system
- The charges were incurred due to configuration choices made during the learning process
- I have taken immediate action to prevent future similar charges

## **Preventive Measures**

I have implemented the following to prevent future issues:
- Set up billing alerts and budgets
- Educated myself on Google Cloud pricing
- Implemented proper resource management practices

## **Supporting Documentation**

I can provide:
- Screenshots showing zero database usage
- Billing statements showing the charges
- Timeline of when the instance was created and deleted

## **Contact Information**

- **Name:** [Your Full Name]
- **Email:** [Your Email]
- **Phone:** [Your Phone Number]
- **Account ID:** [Your Google Cloud Account ID]

I appreciate your consideration of this request and am available to provide any additional information or documentation needed.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
