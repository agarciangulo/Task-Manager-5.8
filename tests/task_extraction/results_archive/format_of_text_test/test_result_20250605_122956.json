  "prompt": "You are TaskExtractor, an expert system that extracts structured task updates from both formal and casual work logs, emails, and messages.\n\nYOUR TASK:\nExtract actionable tasks from the provided text, which may be in various formats (formal reports, casual updates, bullet points, etc.). Follow these precise steps:\n\n1. TEXT ANALYSIS:\n   - Identify the main author of the update\n   - Look for any date information\n   - Recognize different formats (bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.)\n   - Handle both formal and casual language\n\n2. SENDER IDENTIFICATION:\n   - Extract the full name of the person who performed the tasks\n   - Look for patterns like \"From:\", email signatures, or introductory lines\n   - If no name is found, use the email sender's name\n\n3. TASK EXTRACTION STRATEGIES:\n   - Look for tasks in any format: bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.\n   - Extract tasks from both completed and planned sections\n   - Recognize tasks even without explicit \"Completed\" or \"Planned\" labels\n   - Identify action verbs to determine what work was performed\n   - Ignore non-task information like greetings and signatures\n   - IMPORTANT: Extract ALL items as tasks, even single words like \"Resume\" or \"Training\"\n\n4. VAGUE TASK DETECTION (CRITICAL):\n   - Flag tasks as needing more context (set needs_description=true) if they match ANY of these criteria:\n     * Single-word tasks (e.g., \"Resume\", \"Training\", \"Meeting\")\n     * Short phrases without specific details (e.g., \"VC University\", \"Project work\")\n     * Generic descriptions (e.g., \"Worked on project\", \"Made updates\")\n     * Tasks missing what was actually done (e.g., \"Resume\" instead of \"Updated resume\")\n     * Tasks without clear deliverables or outcomes\n   - For each vague task, generate a specific follow-up question asking for:\n     * What specifically was done\n     * What was the outcome or progress made\n     * Any relevant details about the work\n\n5. STATUS DETERMINATION - CLASSIFY AS:\n   - \"Completed\": Tasks described in past tense or marked as done\n   - \"In Progress\": Work mentioned as started but not finished\n   - \"Pending\": Tasks mentioned without completion status\n   - \"Blocked\": Tasks explicitly mentioned as blocked\n\n6. DATE EXTRACTION:\n   - Extract the date when tasks were performed\n   - If not explicitly mentioned, use the email/update date\n   - Standardize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n   - For updates with multiple dates, use the most recent relevant date\n\n7. CATEGORIZATION:\n   - Assign each task to a category based on context\n   - Use section headers, indentation, or prefix labels to determine categories\n   - If a task mentions multiple categories, prefer the most specific one\n   - If no category is explicitly mentioned, use \"General\"\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn a list of tasks in this exact format:\n[\n    {\n        \"task\": \"Detailed description of the task\",\n        \"status\": \"Completed/In Progress/Pending/Blocked\",\n        \"employee\": \"Full name of the person who did the task\",\n        \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n        \"category\": \"Category name\",\n        \"needs_description\": true/false,\n        \"suggested_question\": \"Specific follow-up question for vague tasks\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\nEXAMPLE VAGUE TASKS AND QUESTIONS:\n1. Task: \"Resume\"\n   Question: \"Could you specify what you did with your resume? (e.g., updated specific sections, created new version, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n2. Task: \"VC University\"\n   Question: \"What specific work did you do related to VC University? (e.g., completed specific modules, watched lectures, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n3. Task: \"Meeting\"\n   Question: \"What was this meeting about and what were the key outcomes or decisions made?\"\n   needs_description: true\n\nINPUT TEXT:\nFrom: Keith Jackson <bradley01@pope-soto.net>\nTo: Elizabeth David <igarcia@bishop.com>\nDate: 2025-04-04 20:10:32\nSubject: Daily Work Summary\n\nPlanned Activities:\nAuthentication Revamp\n    Coordinated with the design team to review the Authentication Revamp feature flow., Refactored the Authentication Revamp module to improve clarity and maintainability..\n\nPayment Gateway Integration\n    Finalized the analytics hooks related to Payment Gateway Integration., Implemented logging improvements for Payment Gateway Integration., Documented changes related to the Payment Gateway Integration rollout..\n\nMobile App Performance\n    Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Mobile App Performance., Coordinated with the design team to review the Mobile App Performance feature flow., Refactored the Mobile App Performance module to improve clarity and maintainability..\n\nUser Onboarding Redesign\n    Documented changes related to the User Onboarding Redesign rollout., Implemented logging improvements for User Onboarding Redesign..\n\nCompleted Activities:\nData Warehouse Migration\n    Refactored the Data Warehouse Migration module to improve clarity and maintainability., Created unit tests for Data Warehouse Migration edge cases., Resolved a blocking bug in the Data Warehouse Migration flow., Revised error handling strategy in Data Warehouse Migration to support fallback flows., Coordinated with the design team to review the Data Warehouse Migration feature flow..\n\nMobile App Performance\n    Implemented logging improvements for Mobile App Performance., Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Mobile App Performance., Investigated slow response times in the Mobile App Performance component., Documented changes related to the Mobile App Performance rollout..\n\nCI/CD Pipeline Update\n    Documented changes related to the CI/CD Pipeline Update rollout., Created unit tests for CI/CD Pipeline Update edge cases., Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting CI/CD Pipeline Update., Finalized the analytics hooks related to CI/CD Pipeline Update., Refactored the CI/CD Pipeline Update module to improve clarity and maintainability..\n\nRemember:\n- Extract ALL tasks, even single words or short phrases\n- Flag ANY task that lacks specific details about what was done\n- Generate specific, contextual follow-up questions for vague tasks\n- Use context clues to determine status and categories\n- If a task is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions but still flag for verification\n- Always return a list, even if empty\n",
