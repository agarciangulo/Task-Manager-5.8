Today I worked on optimizing database queries for the Microsoft Azure project and saw significant performance improvements. The team also reviewed the new feature requirements that came from product management for the IBM engagement. In addition, I helped troubleshoot some deployment issues that occurred during our afternoon release window for the Amazon Web Services client.

Tomorrow I'll be focusing on implementing the user dashboard redesign that was approved last week for the Google Cloud project. I'll also need to follow up on the client feedback we received about the Oracle application's loading speed and investigate potential solutions for improving performance on slower devices.
