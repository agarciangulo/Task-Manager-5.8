  "prompt": "You are TaskExtractor, an expert system that extracts structured task updates from both formal and casual work logs, emails, and messages.\n\nYOUR TASK:\nExtract actionable tasks from the provided text, which may be in various formats (formal reports, casual updates, bullet points, etc.). Follow these precise steps:\n\n1. TEXT ANALYSIS:\n   - Identify the main author of the update\n   - Look for any date information\n   - Recognize different formats (bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.)\n   - Handle both formal and casual language\n\n2. SENDER IDENTIFICATION:\n   - Extract the full name of the person who performed the tasks\n   - Look for patterns like \"From:\", email signatures, or introductory lines\n   - If no name is found, use the email sender's name\n\n3. TASK EXTRACTION STRATEGIES:\n   - Look for tasks in any format: bullet points, paragraphs, categories, etc.\n   - Extract tasks from both completed and planned sections\n   - Recognize tasks even without explicit \"Completed\" or \"Planned\" labels\n   - Identify action verbs to determine what work was performed\n   - Ignore non-task information like greetings and signatures\n   - IMPORTANT: Extract ALL items as tasks, even single words like \"Resume\" or \"Training\"\n\n4. VAGUE TASK DETECTION (CRITICAL):\n   - Flag tasks as needing more context (set needs_description=true) if they match ANY of these criteria:\n     * Single-word tasks (e.g., \"Resume\", \"Training\", \"Meeting\")\n     * Short phrases without specific details (e.g., \"VC University\", \"Project work\")\n     * Generic descriptions (e.g., \"Worked on project\", \"Made updates\")\n     * Tasks missing what was actually done (e.g., \"Resume\" instead of \"Updated resume\")\n     * Tasks without clear deliverables or outcomes\n   - For each vague task, generate a specific follow-up question asking for:\n     * What specifically was done\n     * What was the outcome or progress made\n     * Any relevant details about the work\n\n5. STATUS DETERMINATION - CLASSIFY AS:\n   - \"Completed\": Tasks described in past tense or marked as done\n   - \"In Progress\": Work mentioned as started but not finished\n   - \"Pending\": Tasks mentioned without completion status\n   - \"Blocked\": Tasks explicitly mentioned as blocked\n\n6. DATE EXTRACTION:\n   - Extract the date when tasks were performed\n   - If not explicitly mentioned, use the email/update date\n   - Standardize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n   - For updates with multiple dates, use the most recent relevant date\n\n7. CATEGORIZATION:\n   - Assign each task to a category based on context\n   - Use section headers, indentation, or prefix labels to determine categories\n   - If a task mentions multiple categories, prefer the most specific one\n   - If no category is explicitly mentioned, use \"General\"\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn a list of tasks in this exact format:\n[\n    {\n        \"task\": \"Detailed description of the task\",\n        \"status\": \"Completed/In Progress/Pending/Blocked\",\n        \"employee\": \"Full name of the person who did the task\",\n        \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n        \"category\": \"Category name\",\n        \"needs_description\": true/false,\n        \"suggested_question\": \"Specific follow-up question for vague tasks\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\nEXAMPLE VAGUE TASKS AND QUESTIONS:\n1. Task: \"Resume\"\n   Question: \"Could you specify what you did with your resume? (e.g., updated specific sections, created new version, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n2. Task: \"VC University\"\n   Question: \"What specific work did you do related to VC University? (e.g., completed specific modules, watched lectures, etc.)\"\n   needs_description: true\n\n3. Task: \"Meeting\"\n   Question: \"What was this meeting about and what were the key outcomes or decisions made?\"\n   needs_description: true\n\nINPUT TEXT:\nFrom: Debbie Strong <freemanlisa@salazar.com>\nTo: Heather Hall <mariamay@hotmail.com>\nDate: 2025-04-29 05:40:48\nSubject: Daily Work Summary\n\nPlanned Activities:\nUser Onboarding Redesign\n    Created unit tests for User Onboarding Redesign edge cases., Resolved a blocking bug in the User Onboarding Redesign flow., Coordinated with the design team to review the User Onboarding Redesign feature flow., Finalized the analytics hooks related to User Onboarding Redesign..\n\nMobile App Performance\n    Investigated slow response times in the Mobile App Performance component., Finalized the analytics hooks related to Mobile App Performance., Coordinated with the design team to review the Mobile App Performance feature flow..\n\nInternal API Cleanup\n    Investigated slow response times in the Internal API Cleanup component., Created unit tests for Internal API Cleanup edge cases., Coordinated with the design team to review the Internal API Cleanup feature flow., Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Internal API Cleanup., Implemented logging improvements for Internal API Cleanup..\n\nData Warehouse Migration\n    Refactored the Data Warehouse Migration module to improve clarity and maintainability., Created unit tests for Data Warehouse Migration edge cases., Revised error handling strategy in Data Warehouse Migration to support fallback flows., Documented changes related to the Data Warehouse Migration rollout..\n\nCompleted Activities:\nPayment Gateway Integration\n    Resolved a blocking bug in the Payment Gateway Integration flow., Refactored the Payment Gateway Integration module to improve clarity and maintainability., Revised error handling strategy in Payment Gateway Integration to support fallback flows..\n\nCI/CD Pipeline Update\n    Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting CI/CD Pipeline Update., Implemented logging improvements for CI/CD Pipeline Update..\n\nMarketing Dashboard\n    Coordinated with the design team to review the Marketing Dashboard feature flow., Created unit tests for Marketing Dashboard edge cases., Conducted peer review for pull requests affecting Marketing Dashboard..\n\nAuthentication Revamp\n    Resolved a blocking bug in the Authentication Revamp flow., Implemented logging improvements for Authentication Revamp., Revised error handling strategy in Authentication Revamp to support fallback flows., Refactored the Authentication Revamp module to improve clarity and maintainability..\n\nUser Onboarding Redesign\n    Created unit tests for User Onboarding Redesign edge cases., Investigated slow response times in the User Onboarding Redesign component..\n\nRemember:\n- Extract ALL tasks, even single words or short phrases\n- Flag ANY task that lacks specific details about what was done\n- Generate specific, contextual follow-up questions for vague tasks\n- Use context clues to determine status and categories\n- If a task is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions but still flag for verification\n- Always return a list, even if empty\n",
